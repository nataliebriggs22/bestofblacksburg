Their queso is my 2nd favorite queso of all time (Moes queso can't be topped and I stand by that!) It is more than just a dip </shortdesc><body class="- topic/body "><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Cabo Fish Taco</title><image href="download-4.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Image of the outside of Cabo Fish Taco in Blacksburg.</alt></image></fig><p class="- topic/p ">Cabo's Queso Dip is served with fresh and warm tortilla chips and is creamy and flavorful. It has peppers in it to add texture and flavor and is a fantastic starter at Cabo. It pairs perfectly with any item on their menu - especially their quesadillas! </p></body></topic>
